This is a game engine made from scratch in Java, using LWJGL, made with the help of multiple online tutorials as a way for me to learn and 
improve my programming experience. It is fully functional, however, all 3D models and other resources were lost. Thankfully 
the code is still available.

If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to contact me at mark.halka2001@gmail.com
